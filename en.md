# Othello
This is something I made in my early days of learning C++.

# Overview

- Display

Two color matrix LEDs are dynamically controlled for display.

- Base

When a piece is placed, it searches 8 directions (up, right, up, right...) When a piece is placed in a square, the color of the LED is reversed.

When a piece is placed in a square, the color of the square is reversed,
After a piece is placed, all squares (8*8) are searched to see if it can be placed.
If a piece can be placed in any square, the game continues. If not, the game skips or ends.

- Search method

To search upward with white

->If so, continue up one more square, otherwise search the next direction.

->If the above conditions are met and there is a white square above the white square, the puzzle can be reversed

- Computer mode

In computer mode, each square has its own priority and the pieces are placed in randomly selected squares if they have the same priority.

Priority (the higher the number, the higher the priority)

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 9 | 2 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 2 | 9 |
| 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 2 |
| 5 | 3 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 8 | 3 | 5 |
| 6 | 4 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 4 | 6 |
| 6 | 4 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 4 | 6 |
| 5 | 3 | 8 | 7 | 7 | 8 | 3 | 5 |
| 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 2 |
| 9 | 2 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 2 | 9 |

In the beginning of the game, I try to give priority to the center 4Ã—4 to prevent the 4 corners from being taken.

In the middle game we try to avoid squares near the corners to prevent the corners from being taken.

I don't know about the endgame, that's luck.

The next version is in the works!
